## Expansion  

I wont get around to any of these... I am too busy with learning _ML for Security_. The first two suggestion will likely be their own mini-project, which I won't get around to integrating into myPyBackDoor    

* Capture video with web cam, and send (via FTP?). record IFF a human face is in view of camera (via OpenCV), this part is partially done. see my openCV projects DIR. 

* record mic, and conveter to text and transmit 

* [Hijack chrome passwords (pretty easy to do). This compontent is done here, but is easy to integrate in](https://github.com/alik604/chromePasswordThieve)

  * [Tutorial 1](<https://github.com/ProgrammedBoi/password-stealer/blob/master/stealer.pyw>)
  * [Tutorial 2](<https://github.com/ProgrammedBoi/password-proof-of-concept/blob/master/pass_stealer.py>)
*  [Tutorial 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byt3bl33d3r/chrome-decrypter/master/chrome_decrypt.py)
* search for a file call "wallet.dat"ðŸ’¯ðŸ˜ˆðŸ’¹ // %100 evil makes money 

* turn this into a proper [rat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_access_trojan)
  + Bypass antivirus 
  + Sample [1](https://github.com/nathanlopez/Stitch)
